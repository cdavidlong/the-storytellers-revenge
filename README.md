Summary:
	The start scene is the title scene named "Title"

	This project has been the most challenging for me to date. Having stitched the footage a few months back I found myself having to review aspects of the course from previous modules and digging into additional material to make progress. I accept that a long break from the course material compounded this, but life events took precedence. As challenging as this module's project was, I felt I did learn a tremendous amount. 

	Having reviewed the forums and noting the use of AVPro for a contained video playback solution th spherical projection demos, I opted to use it and to build my project around it.

	
	Rubric notes

	The Film:

		Stitching: 			Stitching took some time, but I eventually got the hang of it and I am happy with the results. The joins are not distracting. Several of the videos joined up really well. 

		Editing:			I opted for a simple travel experience allowng a user to move between scenes, with a branched option to take the ferry home after a certain time period.

		Coloring:			I managed to keep a somwewhat overcast look throughout.

		Title and Credits:	I used two methods for this. For the title screen I had a lot of fun with. I used a tutorial I found to add the particle effect to the title screen. The particle effect was created to recreate sparks from a welding device hitting the ground and glowing, before extinguishing while the tour introduction is displated on screen. The credits were set to trigger after the 3rd video is played and animate up the screen to get the attention of the viewer.

	Interactivity:

		Cardboard: 			Cardboard controls are present. I@m currently extending to us the Daydream as I've recently gotten access to one.

		Controls:			Pause, restart and branch controls are present.

		Spatial Audio:		For each scene I used an animated sphere with an attached birdsong sound.

		Choose your path:	The user can choose to move the next scene, or take the ferry home with a branch option displaying 30 seconds into the first clip.

		Particle effect:	I opted to add a particle effect to the title screen.
